# CMPE 202 - Team Project - Starbuck Mobile App on Processing

The idea is to leverage the individual project implementation and re-build the Starbuck Mobile App on processing with animation UI.

## Journal Week #1

### Login Function (Yinghua Qin)

What I have done this week

- I started from looking at some examples of the Processing. 
- Building UI and annimation on processing seems simple. 

What I plan to do next week

- How to import my individual project Java files to Processing so that I could reuse the source code? 
- Which design patterns I should implement on Login function? The state machine? The observation? Those are implemented on the individual project. 
- Would it be cool to create a QR code scan for login on Processing? It seems there is a QR code scan lib avaiable. 
- Would it be cool to add sound when login fail and a happy sound when login success? 

## Journal Week #2

### Login Function (Yinghua Qin)

What I have done this week

- Imported the individaul project Java files to Processing
- Built a login UI with a pre-set PIN 1234
- Tested the login success case - input 1234 (use mouse click)
- Tested the login fail case - input wrong pin (use mouse click)
- Tested the "x" cancel last input chat
- Created a video recording for the showcase


What I plan to do next week

- Implement the design pattern on Login function
- Link with the starbuck source code for screen flow
