Development environment setup instruction (Updated to V2 at November 26, 2018)

    1) Download the jar files here: 
    - https://github.com/nguyensjsu/fa18-202-mystic/tree/master/5.SourceCode/StarbucksGUI/lib/starbucks.jar
    - https://github.com/nguyensjsu/fa18-202-mystic/tree/master/5.SourceCode/StarbucksGUI/lib/starbucksyh.jar
    
    2) Put the jar files to the processing lib folder , such as: - -
    - processing\modes\java\libraries\starbucks\library\starbucks.jar
    - processing\modes\java\libraries\starbucksyh\library\starbucksyh.jar
    
    3) Restart the process IDE
    
    4) Import the lib into processing
    
    5) Download the project from here: https://github.com/nguyensjsu/fa18-202-mystic/tree/master/5.SourceCode/StarbucksGUI
    
    6) Start to update the starbucksGUI.pde for existing screens and commit the changes

Additional Pattern Implementation - Processing Part

    1) Get the above environment setup done
    2) Implement the additional pattern on java file, compile and build as a jar file
    3) Upload the jar file to the lib folder, for example: 
    - https://github.com/nguyensjsu/fa18-202-mystic/tree/master/5.SourceCode/StarbucksGUI/lib/starbucksyh.jar
    4) Put the jar file to the processing folder, for example:
    - processing\modes\java\libraries\starbucksyh\library\starbucksyh.jar
    5) Restart the process IDE
    6) Import the lib into processing
    7) Update the starbucksGUI.pde for new screens and new patterns
    8) Please update the development environment instruction once you have added a new jar file and notify the team to rebase

Additional Pattern Implementation - Build the jar file
    1) Update the prof starbuck package name to self name, such as starbuckYH;
       You can use notepad++ to "replace in files" to replace "package starbuck" to "package starbuckXX", such as "package starbuckYH"
       change the folder name src->main->java->starbuck  to src->main->java->starbuckYH
                              src->test->java->starbuck  to src->test->java->starbuckYH
    2) Re-import the project into eclipse. you will see all your src code package will change to self name.
    3) Update AppSuthProxy.java, set public to "public boolean authenticated = false ;". It is used for team member jar auth status update.
    4) In the build.gradle file, change baseName = 'starbucks' to baseName = 'starbucksYH'
       In the settings.gradle, change rootProject.name = 'starbucksYH'
    5) Using the original "gradlew jar" to build your jar file

## Journal Week #1

What I plan to do next week

- How to import my individual project Java files to Processing so that I could reuse the source code? 
- Which design patterns I should implement on Login function? The state machine? The observation? Those are implemented on the individual project. 
- Would it be cool to create a QR code scan for login on Processing? It seems there is a QR code scan lib avaiable.

## Journal Week #3

### Login Function (Yinghua Qin)

What I have done this week
- I found a way to use the .jar file in processing. 
- With this, I could put all my personal project java code into a jar file and use it in this team project. 
- Instruction: 

      Put the starbucks.jar into the library folder under Processing software.
      processing\modes\java\libraries\starbucks\library\starbucks.jar
      Import the library to the project. 

![](https://github.com/nguyensjsu/fa18-202-mystic/blob/master/yinghua_qin/AddStarbuckJar.png)

- I got all the screens from professor's PDF of personal project
- I worked out the size of the screen and the position mapping as listed on the PDF.
  ​    
  ​    The height should same as the 500 in the size function
  ​    
      int headerHeight=60;
      int h=headerHeight+55*8;  //before:480; now: 500
      
      size(320,500);  //480

- Showcase for week 3
